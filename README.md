# Vue File Upload with Express Backend

This project demonstrates a basic setup for uploading files using Vue.js with the **Vue File Upload component** and **ImageKit Vue.js SDK**. It has an Express.js backend server. The Vue component allows users to select and upload files to the server, and the server handles the file uploads.
